Hereâ€™s an improved and clarified version of your requirements, with emphasis on **hybrid mode for file editing**, not just raw Python code:

---

## ðŸ’¡ Updated Requirement: Hybrid CLI Coding Agent (Structured + Flexible)

Your CLI coding agent must operate in **hybrid mode**, meaning:

> âœ… Use **natural language** for communication and reasoning,
> âœ… Use **structured tool calls** (like `edit_file`) for actual file changes.

---

## ðŸ”§ What This Means Practically

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Natural Language â‰  File Writes**

* Let the LLM **discuss**, **reason**, and **explain** in natural language.
* But **never trust natural language outputs for file changes**.
* File modifications must **always go through a dedicated structured tool**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Mandatory: Structured Tool for File Editing**

You must introduce an `edit_file` tool (if not already present), designed specifically for **safe, contextual file modification**, like Claude Code does.

#### âœ… Requirements for `edit_file` Tool:

```json
{
  "name": "edit_file",
  "description": "Edit specific lines or sections of a file safely.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "path": { "type": "string", "description": "File path to modify" },
      "action": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["insert_before", "insert_after", "replace_range", "append_to_end"],
        "description": "Edit operation type"
      },
      "content": { "type": "string", "description": "The new content to write" },
      "match_text": { "type": "string", "description": "Line or pattern to anchor the edit", "optional": true },
      "start_line": { "type": "integer", "description": "Starting line number (for replacements)", "optional": true },
      "end_line": { "type": "integer", "description": "Ending line number (for replacements)", "optional": true }
    },
    "required": ["path", "action", "content"]
  }
}
```

This ensures:

* Edits are **surgical**, not blunt overwrites.
* You can **trace, test, and revert** changes easily.
* The LLM can **reason in text**, but file actions are **fully structured and auditable**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Prompt Engineering Must Enforce This Workflow**

Update your system prompt to explicitly instruct the model:

```text
- You are a CLI code assistant.
- NEVER write file-changing code directly into your natural language response.
- ONLY use the `edit_file` tool (or similar) to make file modifications.
- You may explain your reasoning first, but all code changes must be submitted via tool calls.
- You may use the `write_file` tool for new files, but never for editing existing files.
```

---

### ðŸ§  Bonus: Inline Patching Mode (Optional Enhancement)

If you want to go Claude-level smart, you can implement a diff-style patcher:

* LLM suggests a "before" and "after" chunk.
* Your tool validates the "before" block exists before applying the "after".

But that's extra polish â€” not essential to get hybrid mode working.

## âœ… Summary

| Task           | Approach                                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code Reasoning | Free-form natural language                                     |
| File Creation  | `write_file` tool                                              |
| File Editing   | **`edit_file` tool (mandatory)**                               |
| Prompting      | Enforce hybrid mode: language for reasoning, tools for actions |

Want me to generate a working version of `edit_file.py` that supports line-based or match-based edits?
