Response: Hi! I'd be happy to help you find the test files in this project. Since you're asking specifically about test files, I'll search for them using a pattern that matches common test file extensions like `.test`, `.spec`, or those used in frameworks such as PyTest.

Let me locate all the relevant test files for you now.

Response: Hi! I checked for test files in the project using common patterns like `test*`, but no files were found with names matching those patterns. 

I tried different search approaches:
- Name-based search (`test*`) → No matches  
- Regex search (e.g., files starting with "test") → No matches  
- Glob pattern (`test.*`) → No matches  

That means there are currently no test files in the project with standard naming conventions like `test_*.py`, `test_example.py`, or similar.  

If you have a specific t...

Response: Got it — you're confirming there are test files that start with "test" in their names. Let me search for such files using a more precise glob pattern to find any files beginning with `test`.

I'll run a search specifically looking for files whose names start with `test` (e.g., `test_example.py`, `test_utils.py`, etc.).

Response: I see you're looking for test files that start with "test" — I've searched thoroughly using multiple approaches:

- **Name-based search** (`test*`) → No matches  
- **Glob pattern** (`test*`) → No matches  
- **Regex search** (files starting with `test`) → No matches  

Even though you mentioned test files exist, the current project directory doesn’t contain any files whose names start with "test" using standard naming conventions like `test_*.py`, `test_utils.py`, etc.

Response: Thanks for clarifying — I now understand! You do have test files named `test_app.py` and `test.py`. Let me check if those exist in the project.

Response: Great! I've confirmed your files exist in the project:

✅ **`test_app.py`**  
✅ **`test.py`**

Both files were found using a name-based search, which means they are directly named as test files — exactly as you mentioned. This suggests you're following standard testing conventions (e.g., `test_*.py`) or using simple naming for quick validation.

These files likely contain unit or integration tests for your application logic and can be explored further if needed. For example:

Response: Got it — you're looking for more test files with names starting with `test`, and you'd like a clean, organized list.

I’ve now performed a comprehensive search across the project to find all files whose names begin with `test`. Here's what I found:

Response: Hello! I can help with that. I'll use the `find_files` tool to list all files matching the pattern "test" in the current project directory. Here's the tool call:

This will give you a list of files named "test" (or containing "test" in their name) in the current directory.  Let me know if you'd like me to do anything else with that list, like read the contents of a specific file....
