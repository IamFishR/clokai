i see no debuggers log. check below convo:
  You: edit the test.py file. remove all the existing code and add      
  the percentage calcualtion function
  [PROCESSING] Analyzing your request...
  Clokai: Okay, I understand. You want me to remove all the
  existing code from `test.py` and add a function to calculate
  percentages. I'll start by reading the contents of `test.py` to       
  understand the current code. Then, I'll create a new function
  called `calculate_percentage` that takes a numerator and a
  denominator as input and returns the percentage. Finally, I'll        
  replace the existing code with the new function and the
  percentage calculation.

  ```json
  [
   {"tool": "read_file", "args": {"path": "test.py"}},
   {"tool": "edit_file", "args": {"path": "test.py", "action":
  "replace_range", "content": "def calculate_percentage(numerator,      
  denominator):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the percentage.\n\n  Args:\n        
   numerator: The numerator.\n    denominator: The denominator.\n       
  \n  Returns:\n    The percentage.\n  \"\"\"\n  if denominator ==      
  0:\n    return 0.0  # Avoid division by zero\n  return (numerator     
   / denominator) * 100"}]
  ```

  You:

● I see the issue! No debug logs are appearing, which means the
  smart tool system's process_user_request function is not even
  being called. The flow is stopping before it gets to our tool
  parsing logic.

  Looking at the output, the AI is responding with the correct JSON
   format, but the system is just displaying the response and not
  processing it further.

  Let me check if there's an issue in the session.py that's
  preventing the smart tool system from being called:

● Update(core\session.py)
  ⎿  Updated core\session.py with 2 additions
       88            try:
       89                # Use the smart tool system for processing
       90                print("[PROCESSING] Analyzing your 
            request...")
       91 +              print("[DEBUG] About to call 
          + smart_tool_system.process_user_request")
       92
       93                final_response, tool_results = 
            smart_tool_system.process_user_request(user_input, 
            messages)
       94 +              print("[DEBUG] 
          + smart_tool_system.process_user_request completed")
       95
       96                # Add the final response to conversation       
            history
       97                messages.append({"role": "assistant",
            "content": final_response})

● Also, let me add debug to the very beginning of the smart tool
  system:

● Update(core\smart_tool_system.py)
  ⎿  Updated core\smart_tool_system.py with 1 addition
       56            Main entry point - processes user request with 
            full smart workflow
       57            Returns: (final_response, tool_results)
       58            """
       59 +          print("[DEBUG] 
          + SmartToolSystem.process_user_request called")
       60            try:
       61                context = 
            ExecutionContext(user_input=user_input)
