[PROCESSING] Analyzing your request...

Clokai: Hello! I can help with that. I'll use the `find_files` tool to list all files matching the pattern "test" in the current project directory. Here's the tool call:

```json
[
  {"tool": "find_files", "args": {"pattern": "test", "search_type": "name", "max_results": 10}}
]
```

This will give you a list of files named "test" (or containing "test" in their name) in the current directory.  Let me know if you'd like me to do anything else with that list, like read the contents of a specific file.

Clokai: Okay, here's a list of the test files I found:

1. test.py
2. test_app.py
3. test_tools_only.py

These files seem to be the ones you created for testing.  Is there anything specific you'd like to do with these files? For example, I can read the contents of `test.py` or `test_app.py` if you'd like to see what they contain. Just let me know!
